# hello :)
was a place of mystery to the Klamath Indians.The Klamath 😋
Indians must have lived in the region as early as 7,700 years ago, because
artifacts such as obsidian tools, spear throwers, and moccasins have been
found beneath the Mazama ash layers to the north and east of Crater Lake.
The Klamath Indians describe the catastropic eruption of Mount Mazama and
the creation of Crater Lake in one of their legends. Their legend of a
raging war between two great volcanoes, Mount Mazama and Mount Shasta,
parallels the geological history of Crater Lake.
